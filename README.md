# ReactJobManager
Showcase of managing a React project in multiple components that interact with one another.

You can add, edit and delete jobs. 
Jobs are ordered by creation time and can have multiple job types. These are sorted alphabetically. 
No references to document - everything is handled through React useState.
Local storage is utilised.
There is protection in place for having unique job names, including when editing.
